===========================
Introduction to surmise
===========================

surmise is a Python package that is designed to provide a surrogate model
interface for calibration, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

surmise is built with numpy and scipy, with an optional scikit-learn dependency.

Please refer to the [project] and [project.optional-dependencies] sections of pyproject.toml 
for details.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the command line, use one of the following commands to install surmise::

 pip install surmise
 pip install surmise[scikit-learn]      # to include scikit-learn in installation
 pip install surmise[all]               # to include all optional dependencies

The package scikit-learn is required by specific methods as stated above.
These packages can be installed along with surmise via the commands listed.

The list of available .whl files can be found under `PyPI-wheel`_.  If a wheel file
for your preferred platform is not listed, surmise has to be built from source,
which requires extra dependencies::

 git clone https://github.com/bandframework/surmise/
 cd surmise
 python -m pip install --upgrade pip
 pip install build Cython
 pip install scikit-learn (optional, required by full test suite)
 python -m build --wheel
 pip install dist/surmise-<version info>.whl

.. note::

    Direct installation of surmise requires Cython to build C executable.
    On a Windows platform Cython is supported by Microsoft build tools, for which installation
    is outside pip; see `Microsoft build tools`_ for details.

Testing
~~~~~~~

Testing of surmise can be performed after cloning the repository. The test suite requires the pytest_,
pytest-cov_, and scikit-learn_ packages to be installed.  These packages can be installed via::

 pip install pytest pytest-cov scikit-learn

The full test suite can then be run from the `tests/` directory of the source distribution by the command::

 cd /path/to/surmise/tests/
 python -m pytest        # (no coverage report)
 python -m pytest --cov  # (with console coverage report)

Access to the test suite with specific testing options are available in the ``tests`` directory.
To see a complete list of options, run::

 ./path/to/surmise/tests/run-tests.sh -h

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation is stored in ``docs/`` and is hosted at `Read the Docs <http://surmise.readthedocs.io>`_.

Users and developers that would like to generate the documentation locally are
encouraged to use ``tox``, which automatically creates a dedicated,
fully-functioning virtual environment for the task.  Refer to the online
developer's guide (or ``docs/tox.rst``) for help setting up ``tox`` and using
it to generate documentation.
