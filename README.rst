Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the command line, use the following command to install surmise::

 pip install surmise==0.1.0


Alternatively, the source code can be downloaded to the local folder, and the
package can be installed from the .tar file.

Testing
~~~~~~~

The test suite requires the pytest_ and pytest-cov_ packages to be installed
and can be run from the ``tests/`` directory of the source distribution by running::

./run-tests.sh

If you have the source distribution, you can run the tests in the top-level
directory containing the setup script with ::

 python setup.py test

Further options are available for testing. To see a complete list of options, run::

 ./run-tests.sh -h

Coverage reports are produced under the relevant directory only if all tests are used.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation is stored in ``docs/`` and is compiled with the Sphinx Python
documentation generator. It is written in the reStructuredText format. These
files are hosted at `Read the Docs <http://surmise.readthedocs.io>`_.

To compile the documentation, first ensure that Sphinx is installed. Then, to
generate documentation, run command ``make html`` from terminal within this directory as follows ::

 cd docs
 make html

The HTML files are then stored in ``docs/_build/html``
