abstract = {This white paper is the result of a collaboration by many of those that attended a workshop at the facility for rare isotope beams (FRIB), organized by the FRIB Theory Alliance (FRIB-TA), on ‘Theoretical Justifications and Motivations for Early High-Profile FRIB Experiments’. It covers a wide range of topics related to the science that will be explored at FRIB. After a brief introduction, the sections address: section 2: Overview of theoretical methods, section 3: Experimental capabilities, section 4: Structure, section 5: Near-threshold Physics, section 6: Reaction mechanisms, section 7: Nuclear equations of state, section 8: Nuclear astrophysics, section 9: Fundamental symmetries, and section 10: Experimental design and uncertainty quantification.}
