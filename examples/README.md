# Example 1

To illustrate how the `surmrise`'s  `emulator` object works in practice, we use the falling ball example.

# Example 2

To illustrate how the `surmrise`'s  `calibrator` object works in practice, we use Example 1's falling ball example.

# Example 3

The data set in this example is provided by Derek Bingham and Jason Loeppky, and the experiments with this data set are discussed in [(Gramacy, 2020)](https://bookdown.org/rbg/surrogates/chap8.html) . 

This example demonstrates how to use `surmrise`'s  `emulator` and  `calibrator` objects.

# Example 4

This example illustrates the Bayesian parameter inference of Susceptible-Infected Recovered (SIR) type epidemic model via  `surmrise`'s  `emulator` and  `calibrator` objects. 

Although there are many model parameters, we estimated most of them based on the epidemiological studies of COVID-19, and infer only 10 influential parameters in this example.

# Example 5
  
  This example shows how to integrate an existing package `GPy` to the `surmrise`'s framework.
